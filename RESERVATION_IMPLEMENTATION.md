# Camper Reservation List Implementation

This document describes the reservation list functionality that has been implemented for the CamperRentChecks Android app.

## Features Added

### 1. Reservation Data Model
- **ReservationEntity**: A comprehensive data model for camper reservations including:
  - Camper model information
  - Customer details
  - Rental dates (start/end)
  - Reservation status (pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled)
  - Pricing information (daily rate and total)

### 2. Database Layer
- **ReservationDao**: Database access operations for reservations
- **Updated AppDatabase**: Version 2 with both Todo and Reservation entities
- Support for querying reservations by status and date ordering

### 3. HomeScreen UI Improvements
- **Reservation Cards**: Beautiful card-based layout showing reservation details
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded status chips for easy visual identification
- **Comprehensive Information Display**: Shows camper model, customer, dates, and pricing
- **Sample Data Button**: Easy way to populate with test reservations

### 4. Architecture Updates
- **HomeViewModel**: Updated to work with reservations instead of todos
- **HomeState**: Modified to represent reservation data
- **Koin Configuration**: Updated dependency injection for reservation components

## UI Design

The HomeScreen now displays:
- A header showing "Camper Reservations"
- Total reservation count
- A scrollable list of reservation cards, each showing:
  - Camper model (prominent title)
  - Status chip with color coding
  - Customer name
  - Rental dates
  - Pricing information (daily rate and total)

## Data Structure

Each reservation contains:
```kotlin
data class ReservationEntity(
  val id: Long,
  val camperModel: String,        // e.g., "VW California"
  val customerName: String,       // e.g., "John Doe"
  val startDate: String,          // e.g., "2024-01-15"
  val endDate: String,            // e.g., "2024-01-20"
  val status: String,             // "pending", "confirmed", "completed", "cancelled"
  val pricePerDay: Double,        // e.g., 120.0
  val totalPrice: Double          // e.g., 600.0
)
```

## Sample Data

The implementation includes sample reservations for testing:
- VW California rental by John Doe (confirmed)
- Mercedes Marco Polo rental by Jane Smith (pending)
- Ford Transit Custom rental by Bob Johnson (completed)

This provides a complete, functional reservation management system for the camper rental business.
